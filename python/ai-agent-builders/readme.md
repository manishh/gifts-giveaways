# AI Agent Builders

This repository contains simple examples of AI agents built using three popular Python frameworks: **LangChain**, **AutoGen**, and **CrewAI**. Each example demonstrates how to build a simple AI-powered task manager that supports two core operations:

1. **Add Task** – Creates a new task from a natural language input (e.g., *"Remind me to buy milk tomorrow"*)
2. **List Tasks** – Displays all current tasks in the user's task list

Each `.py` file contains a standalone example with minimal setup to help you get started quickly.

## Files Included

* `langchain_agent.py` – Agent built using LangChain
* `autogen_agent.py` – Agent built using AutoGen
* `crewai_agent.py` and `taskmanager_agent.yaml` – Agent built using CrewAI
* `requirements.txt` – Dependencies for all examples

## Notes

* These examples are intended for demonstration purposes and require a valid **Google/Gemini API key** set via environment variables.
* While the examples are functional, they are provided **as-is**, without warranties, guarantees, or any support.
* For more details, refer to each framework’s official documentation:
  * [LangChain Docs](https://docs.langchain.com/)
  * [AutoGen Docs](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)
  * [CrewAI Docs](https://docs.crewai.com/)
