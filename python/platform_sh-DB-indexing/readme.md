# Basics Of Database Indexing

The `indexing_demo.sql` file in this directory contains all the necessary SQL to create the users table, apply B-tree, Hash, and Full-text indexes, and sample queries that could benefit from these indexes. It’s recommended to run these queries both before and after applying the indexes to observe the performance difference.

While the SQL provided here can populate the users table with 20 records, it’s strongly recommended to insert **_at least_** a few hundred records to better see the impact of indexing on performance.

The SQL in this file is compatible with both MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL databases.
